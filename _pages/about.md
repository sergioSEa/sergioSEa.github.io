# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Microbiome group](https://cs.stanford.edu/) at the [University Medical Center Groningen](https://www.umcg.nl), under the supervision of  Prof. [Jingyuan Fu](https://www.rug.nl/research/genetics/staff/jingyuan-fu)[[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=7OHBkYMAAAAJ&hl=en)] and [Sasha Zhernakova](https://www.rug.nl/research/genetics/staff/alexandra-(sasha)-zhernakova) [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lrt2jA8AAAAJ&hl=en)]. 
* I hold a MSc degree in Bioinformatics - Computational Biology track - from the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/). During my MSc studies, I was part-time employed as a bioinformatician at [Evaxion Biotech](https://www.evaxion-biotech.com) and Rigshospitalet, [Genomic Medicine](https://www.rigshospitalet.dk/afdelinger-og-klinikker/diagnostisk/genomisk-medicin/Sider/default.aspx).
* I hold a BSc degree in Biotechnology - Human and Biomedical biotechnology track - from the [Technical University of Valencia](http://www.upv.es). During my studies I performed two academic exchanges to [Jagiellonian University](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) (9 months) and [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (6 months). 
* My research interests lie in genomics. I am interested in combining genomic data with other omic datasets to understand complex biological phenomenons such as immunity or cardiovascular events. Currently, I focus on the human gut microbiome.
* My previous computational research experience include phylogenomic work in Bird 10,000 Genome project, under the supervison of [Guojie Zhang](http://zhanggjlab.org), and short research internships at [Brunak's group](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/research/disease-systems-biology/brunak/) and [JL Micol's](https://genetics.edu.umh.es), in addition to my work in clinical genomics at Genomic Medicine.
