# About

I am a computational biologist currently pursuing my doctoral degree at the [University Medical Center](https://www.umcg.nl) in Groningen, The Netherlands. My research focuses on investigating the aging of the immune system and the risk of cardiovascular disease using population data. Specifically, I explore the impact of the human microbiome, along with other life exposures and genetic background, on the immune system.

# My Journey 

## May 2023 - September 2024: Visiting Scholar, University of Trento

I worked as a visiting scholar at the [Computational Metagenomics group](http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/) under the supervision of [Nicola Segata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZXjO-Q4AAAAJ) in Trento, Italy. My research focused on integrating large-scale metagenomic data at the subspecies level resolution to understand its association with human health and disease.

## January 2020 - 2024: PhD Studies, University Medical Center Groningen

Ph.D. in the Microbiome group at the [University Medical Center Groningen](https://www.umcg.nl) under the supervision of Prof. [Jingyuan Fu](https://www.rug.nl/research/genetics/staff/jingyuan-fu) [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=7OHBkYMAAAAJ&hl=en)] and [Sasha Zhernakova](https://www.rug.nl/research/genetics/staff/alexandra-(sasha)-zhernakova) [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lrt2jA8AAAAJ&hl=en)], I work closely with the Lifelines project, a three-generations population cohort from Northern Netherlands. By analyzing the gut microbiome, genetics, lifestyle, diet, immune parameters, and metabolism data from the cohort participants, I explore various research questions.

## September 2018 - 2020: MSc Studies, University of Copenhagen

I pursued a Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/), Denmark. During this two-year program, I honed my expertise in bioinformatics, statistics, and data science. My MSc work was part of the Bird 10,000 Genome project at the [Centre for Biodiversity Genomics](http://zhanggjlab.org) under the supervision of Guojie Zhang ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hcIDquMAAAAJ&hl=en)). Throughout my MSc studies, I also worked part-time as a bioinformatician at [Evaxion Biotech](https://www.evaxion-biotech.com) and Rigshospitalet, [Genomic Medicine](https://www.rigshospitalet.dk/afdelinger-og-klinikker/diagnostisk/genomisk-medicin/Sider/default.aspx).

## September 2013 - 2018: BSc Studies, Technical University of Valencia

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology - Human and Biomedical biotechnology track - from the [Technical University of Valencia](http://www.upv.es).  This is a 4-year program, in which I had the change to undergone two academic exchanges. First I went to Krakow (Poland), to [Jagiellonian University](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) (9 months). Later I moved to Beijing (China) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (6 months).
Once I finished my studies and before starting my MSc, I was an intern at  [JL Micol's](https://genetics.edu.umh.es) group.
