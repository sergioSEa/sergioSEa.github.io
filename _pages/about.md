# About
 
<img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/sergioSEa/sergioSEa.github.io/blob/master/files/groningen.jpeg?">

Hey there! I'm Sergio. I am a computational biologist currently making its way through his graduate studies at the [University Medical Center](https://www.umcg.nl) in Groningen, The Netherlands (for a wonderful sunset view of the city check the pic on the left!).  
My current work consists on analysing a plethora of heath and molecular data to answer questions regarding ageing and health, in particular I try to identify what factors determine that our immune system ages healthy. 
  
I am profoundly interested in the application of modern genomic technologies in science and society. Lately I have focussed on the gut microbiome, an incredibly complex ecosystem that, thanks to genomics advances, we are now starting to understand in great detail.  

# My Journey 

## January 2020 - 2024 : PhD studies in the Netherlands
I started my Ph.D. studies on January 2020. Moved to a new city (Groningen) and country (The Netherlands).
I am a Ph.D. student in the Microbiome group at the [University Medical Center Groningen](https://www.umcg.nl), under the supervision of  Prof. [Jingyuan Fu](https://www.rug.nl/research/genetics/staff/jingyuan-fu)[[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=7OHBkYMAAAAJ&hl=en)] and [Sasha Zhernakova](https://www.rug.nl/research/genetics/staff/alexandra-(sasha)-zhernakova) [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lrt2jA8AAAAJ&hl=en)]. 
The group works really close with Lifelines, a three-generations population cohort from Northern Netherlands. Working with this data will allow me to investigate different research questions from a variety of different directions, by investigating the gut microbiome of the cohort participants, their genetics, lifestyle, diet, immune parameters or metabolism.

## September 2018 - 2020 : MSc studies in Denmark
I moved to Denmark to study a MSc degree in Bioinformatics at the  [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/).  This is a wonderful two-year program that allowed me to develop my bioinformatics expertise, including statistics and data science. The program also allowed me to test myself by performing several research projects in world-class scientific groups. After a short intership at [Brunak's group](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/research/disease-systems-biology/brunak/) in the Center for Protein Research,  I joined the [Centre for Biodiversity Genomics](http://zhanggjlab.org), were I performed my MSc thesis as part of the Bird 10,000 Genome project under the supervision of  Guojie Zhang([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hcIDquMAAAAJ&hl=en))

In addition, during my MSc studies, I was part-time employed as a bioinformatician at [Evaxion Biotech](https://www.evaxion-biotech.com) and Rigshospitalet, [Genomic Medicine](https://www.rigshospitalet.dk/afdelinger-og-klinikker/diagnostisk/genomisk-medicin/Sider/default.aspx).

## September 2013 - 2018 : BSc studies in Spain
I hold a BSc degree in Biotechnology - Human and Biomedical biotechnology track - from the [Technical University of Valencia](http://www.upv.es).  This is a 4-year program, in which I had the change to undergone two academic exchanges. First I went to Krakow (Poland), to [Jagiellonian University](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) (9 months). Later I moved to Beijing (China) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (6 months).
Once I finished my studies and before starting my MSc, I was an intern at  [JL Micol's](https://genetics.edu.umh.es) group.
